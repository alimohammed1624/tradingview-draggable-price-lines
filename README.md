## Live EURUSD data

To use live EURUSD market data (Polygon.io aggregates per second), set in your environment:

- `VITE_POLYGON_API_KEY` – your Polygon.io API key (get one at https://polygon.io/dashboard/keys)

Then toggle **Live (EURUSD)** in the Place trade card. Without this key, the switch stays on Simulated.
